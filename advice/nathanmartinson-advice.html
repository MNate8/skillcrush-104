			<h1>Hi my name is Nathaniel Martinson and I have some advice for you!</h1>
			<h4>You can achieve anything, but you'll never achieve anything if you don't try!</h4>
			<p>I've always been afraid to go after the careers that I <em>really</em> wanted. I had a voice in my head that
			kept telling me that those jobs are for creative and exceptionally intelligent people. So I always went for the jobs
		that anyone would be able to do.</p>

		<p>Time has shown me that anyone can have success in the careers of their dreams if the just work for them. It takes time
			and patience and hard work, but it can be done. Most things are achievable, but not if you are to afraid to try.</p>

			<p>If I could go back years and tell myself one thing it would just simply be "believe in yourself".</p>
